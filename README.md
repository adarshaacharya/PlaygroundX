Esbuild : esbuild-wasm

Transform Api :
https://esbuild.github.io/api/#transform-api

load esbuild.wasm file in browser in some way, to do the transpiling

transform function : just to do transpiling no for bundling
build : to bundle

Problems : 
Transform/Transpile

Caching the fetching process from unpkgLoading CSS support for bundler

/**
 * NOTE : 
 * bundling = build = finding some file, loading it, transpiling it, joining bunch of diff file together
